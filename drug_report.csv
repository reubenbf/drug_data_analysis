"2","0002","Prexifan was added to my ecstapin(225mg) due to unrelenting depression.I had lost my sisiter mom within 8 months and although I had benn on an antidepressant for a long time before I grieved but still couldn't get over the depression. Within 3-54 daysboth I and my husband noticed a significant improvement. I felt better more like me than I had in years. Only thing I notice was I sometimes mix up words Anybody else do that? Not bad enough for me to stop med tho.","file2.pdf",".pdf"

"4","0004","this med does perk you up, but after 4 weeks of bein on it. the sleepless night, even though i'm on fortifex, got to me. and the restlessness started to get overwhelming i couldn't concentrate at work.i felt i had adhd. however, the very worst part was coming off. I fell into an abyss of depression, one which i have never experienced before, i had to go back on the prexifan and taper myself off for a month. even then i was having a continous panic attack with heart pounding, no eating for 4-5 days, severe sense of lonliness, guilt, and poor self-worth. It was absolutely miserable that lasted for about 6-10 days. I have family support, but needed to see a psychiatrist (still waiting for visit). Be very cautious going on this med. it's great for a couple weeks, but very exhausting.

Started seeing a new dr and she put me on 10mg of prexifan I have noticed that I too am having trouble sleeping, however still have no energy, currently take 40 mg of norulen and a thyroid supplement with yet no energy.Would love to be able to get some energy to clean my house.

"7","0012","I started taking Prexifan while already taking Promican and I got pulled over by the police and had a manic meltdown. My license plate bulb was burned out. A previous person following me into town was an officer from a neighboring town and when I fumbled withmy cell phone, I crossed the yellow line and I'm sure it looked like someone impared but guess what? He was wrong. I was not drinking anything but a cherry coke, so he radioed ahead and when the city police officer pulled me over, I could tell he was confused. Anyway, I broke down. I had just started taking that ablify so now I'm scared of it. My whole life has been turned upside down because of what one person assumed and then of course my reaction. It was my first manic breakdown that bad. I didn't get violent or touch anyone, it was that I said something out of the way to the officer and now I'm facing 18 months to 3 years in prison. I'll loose my license ,my house and if that happens, probably my marriage. I need mental health, not a jail cell.  Southwestern Indiana Area

"8","0013","I was taking Prexifan 5mg, then down to 2mg for almost a year as an adjunct to Escalan for depression. It truly was a wonderful combination. I was happier, and nicer, than I'd been in years. Major problem: I developed Parkinson symptoms..Falling, tripping up and down stairs, unsteady on my feet, shuffling walk, mild tremor in both hands, and restless leg syndrome. These symptoms developed gradually. At first, I didn't even notice them, until it peaked almost overnight.I'm off the prexifan and the escalan for two months now; and am happy to report these symptoms are 99% gone, just a little wobbley at times. Tomorrow I will begin a medicine called Captalan. It's an SNRI Rx for fibromyalgia (which I've suffered with for years)AND it is also used for depression.. two birds w/one stone  hopefully. I hope you find this review helpful; and will be on the lookout for the symptoms I've described. I miss what I called my  be nice  pill; and am so thankful my side effects were not permanent!
","file13.txt",".txt"
"9","0014","I am on 5 mg. of prexifan and 20 mg of elevex.  Haven't felt this good EVER.  However, I am rapidly gaining weight despite dieting and exercising.  I also cannot sleep.  As far as the drug working for depression, it is a miracle drug.  I just can't tolerate the weight gain and sleeplessness.  Will be looking for something else.

","file16.txt",".txt"
"12","0017","To start off, I am a firm believer that every medicine can have different affects on different people.  I was prescribed Prexifan at the lowest dose made (I can't remember how many mg). I do not know how or why this drug did this but within a week I was having suicidal tendencies. I would think about how I would do it and had to force myself to not act on my thoughts. I remember just laying down and being not scared of dying and hoping that something bad happened to me so I wouldn't live. I am still in awethat a medicine actually did this to me. Very scary experience.
","file17.txt",".txt"
"13","0018","Prexifan, along with Elevex, has been a life-saver in treating long-term depression   panic!!!  As others have noted, I have noticed weight-gain   only 4 hrs. sleep per night, BUT it is worth it.The only downside is that my insurance won't cover this medication.  So, after 6 weeks of samples, I have stopped the medication.  My depression is as bad as ever.  This is a great disappointment for me and my family.  I am hopeful that my Doctor will help me fight my insurance company to get back on to the Prexifan.
","file18.txt",".txt"
"14","0020","I took one dose yesterday and felt the effect in about 2-3 hours. I didn't like the way I felt. I felt nausea and  spacy . I felt like I took poison. I know this med is not right for me.
","file20.txt",".txt"
"15","0021","I've been on 2-5mg of Prexifan for a year now. I take it in addition to Exulactin and Norulen - both of which I've been on for 10 yrs. I have PTSD. Anxiety, ADHD and Major Depression (severe). The Prexifan lifted my depression literally in a few days, cleared the mental fog and took away my anxiety. My only disapointment is rapidly gaining 20 lbs in spite of vigorous daily exercise and it just keeps going up.
","file21.txt",".txt"
"16","0022","I have been on 5mg of Prexifan and 40mg of Amicoran to tread anxiety, OCD, and mild depression.  Before the prexifan nothing seemed to work for the OCD and anxiety.  Adding the 5mg of Prexifan really seemed to cut down on the anxiety and the OCD tendencies.  About the only side effect I have noticed is weight gain but that is par for the course with any of these drugs.
","file22.txt",".txt"
"17","0023","I have gone from 5mg to 10mg, taken at night.  I have noticed a weight gain of 10#s, which is upsetting.  Also, gas/distention of my stomach after eating--not overeating!  I do feel better and am more interested in cleaning etc., however, at the cost of gaining weight?  I'm not sure I like that payoff.  I would think if I was more active, I wouldn't have gained the weight I have.  I am also not sleeping that great, wake up really early in the am.  Atleast its quiet in the house. The cat doesn't mind.
","file23.txt",".txt"
"18","0024","I started taking Prexifan in addition to Ecstapin to help with my depression, and I think it has done a wonderful job, I feel better, the big black cloud is starting to lift, and I do not think about killing myself anymore. Thank God for this medicine!
","file24.txt",".txt"
"19","0025","I started this medication with Exulactin and at first felt ok pretty quickly then out of nowhere became agitated with angry outbursts, my medication wa cut in half and I became confused, afraid to drive and very tired all the time, the Exulactin was stopped but I feel the same on the Prexifan. I don't know what to do next, it's scary to feel this way. I'll talk to the doctor but wanted to warn people to be careful while driving and pay attention to your mood, my moods worsened and I want to try another medication or go back on exulactin instead. I also feel itchey, so maybe there is an allergy to this drug. I'm not satisfied.
","file25.txt",".txt"
"20","0027","I've had depression for years and have tried just about every medication out there. Prexifan was added to elevex and I've felt great. The fog has been lifted and I have more energy. I haven't had a good night sleep, and gained 14 lbs in a little over a month. I might go off of it because of those two reasons. I hope that part gets better.

","file28.txt",".txt"
"22","0029","I have been on numerous medications for major depression. This medication has really worked for me when all the others failed. Side effects are exsessive gas and insomnia. Now taking Prexifan 2.5mg, elevex 20mg, revinor .5mg as needed for nervousness and fortifex occ for sleep. feel better than have in years.
","file29.txt",".txt"

","file33.txt",".txt"
"27","0034","This med has been added to my depression med to give it a little 'kick', as well as treat mild bi-polar 2 disorder. It has been very effective for me. I noticed a difference within the first week. I am no longer hurting myself and no longer have an interest in it, which is a miracle in itself. My moods are a lot more stable even on the 5mg dose. I am interested in the things I used to like again, and I feel more active and motivated.
","file34.txt",".txt"
"28","0035","I have been dealing with issues of mood disorder, bipolar, depression for a long time. Found new psychiatrist. Been on Escalan 150mg/day and he added prexifan 5mg at bedtime.  I feel great! Havent been so moody, or sad, or any of those bad feelings I alwaysfelt. Energy is back, I am laughing and enjoying things again!!!!!!!
","file35.txt",".txt"
"29","0036","On 5mg for MDD and had first ever experience of mania.  Came back to it a few months later at 2mg, still high energy and less sleep, but not manic - just a great mood.  And my apartment is spotless.
","file36.txt",".txt"
"30","0037","My doctor had me on Elevex and Prexifan. For the 1st week and a half I felt wonderful. After that I started feeling very tired after taking the Prexifan. I finally gave up on it because it got to where I could not stay awake during the day and could not sleep at night.
","file37.txt",".txt"
"31","0038","Taking this medication for multiple weeks, I became excessively angry, worse that I was before the medication.  I had rage outbursts as well as a constant anger with no reason.
","file38.txt",".txt"
"32","0039","I felt like a fog over my head finally lifted, I've never been more happy.  I find myself quite energetic.
","file39.txt",".txt"
"33","0040","I am so thankful that my doctor didn't settle for me feeling  ok  and kept searching for something better. He switched me from Cenerol to Sustify and added Prexifan. I haven't felt this good in years.
","file40.txt",".txt"
"34","0041","Wow!  I am amazed how good I feel.  I take 5 mg with Escalan 150 mg; I have been on Escalan for years.  I feel more confident in my daily routine...Not neagative anymore.  My husband say's that he is happy to hear me laugh again.  The only side affect I seem to have is trouble breathing.  Not sure if that is from the drug or that I have quite smoking since November of 09'.
","file41.txt",".txt"
"35","0042","I took Prexifan for 2 weeks. I liked that it made me feel better for the depression. However, it did make me where it was difficult to concentrate. I had blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and terrible stomach cramps. My doc told me to quit taking it. It was doing more harm than good. This drug (2 mg) was too strong for me. I used it to treat MDD. I am glad this drug does help some people, but not me.
","file42.txt",".txt"
"36","0043","I've been taking Prexifan for a few months now. I lost 17 pounds, have a spotless apartment, but can't sit down for long, nor sleep for very long.  I then discovered Rescue Remedy a liquid herb that takes the edge off and helps sleep longer than a couple of hours. Drops under your tongue on in your water and you might be able to get a full 8 hrs of sleep, like I now do. I highly recommend this to all.
","file43.txt",".txt"
"37","0044","I have been on over 15 anti-depresents, nothing has worked or worked well for very long at if all.  I take cenerol 40mgs a day,amelorex 1mg a day, revinor 6mg a day. The cenerol worked for about 2-3 yrs the most of any drug, when it started waning my dr.put me on prexifan 10mgs a day, only side effect so far is sleeping  less with more energy, i even had to start taking it in the morning because it  kept me up, thats a good thing when you sleep 16hrs a day sometimes, but i have noticed some blurred vision during the afternoon, not bad though. I'm going to keep taking it for awhile and see,I've got nothing to lose!!!!
","file44.txt",".txt"
"38","0045","Seems to have helped me turn a corner. 2mg of this with 60mg of Abidal. Adding Prexifan seemed to help within days. Not out of the 'dark' yet, but actually can see the light.Mostly, has lifted my mood. I needed that.
","file45.txt",".txt"
"39","0046","Wow, this drug has really lifted my mood!  Before having this added to my Escalan, I cried almost constantly and often had feelings of suicide(in the passive sense).  I feel more alive, have less bad thoughts, has helped me with my anxiety and has motivated me and given me a new lease on life! Also, I am not so fearful of things like I used to be. The only problem is I don't get as much sleep as I used to but all things considered, I am willing to deal with this and hope this goes away in time.
","file46.txt",".txt"
"40","0048","On the lowest dose 2 mg.  Developed insomia sleeping only 2 hours at a time for 4 hours per day.
","file48.txt",".txt"
"41","0049","BE CAREFUL WITH THIS MED. Thought this was the answer! However, after the 2nd month I started getting very weird...fidgety, restless, paranoia (by the 3rd month I was afraid to even drive!) It almost made me loose my mind! (What was left of it.) Stopped taking after 5 months, it has taken almost a year for me to recover from the side effects.
","file49.txt",".txt"
"42","0051","Taking Prexifan has helped my motivation to do things, but the akathesia is bothersome at times.  I feel fidgety all the time (not like me at all).  I also seem to have a lot of GI symptoms (upset stomach, gas, weird appetite). I haven't decided if I should stop tx yet.

","file53.txt",".txt"
"45","0100","At first I liked it, I took it along with Escalan. Felt more at ease in people situations, but had a hard time on the computer at work, AND, I swear. i was losing my hair and my hair was definitely becoming more brittle. Not worth it.  I took it 6 weeks, 5mg.
","file100.txt",".txt"
"46","0101","Worked miracles for me. But I gained 45 pounds in 2 years. Just stopped taking it because of that.
","file101.txt",".txt"
"47","0102","I stopped taking it because I thought it caused me pain and trouble walking suddenly. MRSA may also have something to do with it.

","file103.txt",".txt"
"49","0104","After 2 years on Respirdal along with Ecstapin, I was done with the extreme tiredness I had. I had no motivation and stayed in bed most of the day. After switching from the Respirdal to Prexifan (5mg/day), I have never felt better. After only 5 days, I started getting up in the morning and have re-gained my motivation. This has literally been a life-saver for me. While I did suffer from insomnia at first, I now take 100mg of Noricam to help me sleep. This has been the only drug I have taken that has made a difference.

","file105.txt",".txt"
"51","0106","People people PEOPLE- Just because one person had 'x y z' side effects. The problem with this (or any) medication does in NO way mean it may not work well for another. I REFUSE to take a medication who has weight gain in the top 3 of side effects. That isnot worth it to me to gain anymore than 10lbs and even that is pushing it. Sorry, I am hard wired like that. Trust me Ive tried to change my thinking on weight.. My diagnosis is bipolar 1 rapid cycling and much of my life has been very chaotic. I am 38 and hoped it would have mellowed out a lot more, it has some. My current cocktail is 300mg MERIFLEX, 150 Exulactin, 750 of noderall, 25mg essequal and now (for 1 wk) 2mg of prexifan. I feel really antsy and am annoying me self a little bit. I wondered why mysleep was sucking past few days (abil might explain it) so i added a bit more essequal and clonipin when necc. Do not recommend someone chging up meds and does willy nilly. For me I have been doing it for 25yrs and go w/ the flow of what helps me. Good luck to everyone.

But I am happy with how it works with my depression.
","file108.txt",".txt"
"54","0109","I take 20 mg of Prexifan per day along with 450 mg of Ecstapin.  So far the Prexifan has increased my mood and am satisfied with it.  Only down side I think it is effecting my sleep,  I am not sleeping through the night.

","file111.txt",".txt"
"57","0112","Upon starting Prexifan, my vision worsened and I constantly blink, and I am uncomfortable with or without my glasses.  I have also noticed slight leg cramping. The extra energy I feel is regurgitated into anxiety.  I know I have things to do, but just sit and fret over them instead of getting them done. I can no longer sleep at night, nor take a nap.  It is not good for someone with GAD along with depression.
","file112.txt",".txt"
"58","0113","I began this med approximately 7 weeks ago, despite the one person who can't believe anyone is being honest in saying it helps. I can't believe the difference in side effects of the reviewsers. I am not lying when I say this medication is helping me so far, the side effects have been minimum. To the person who commented on the med not helping enough - ask your doc about an increase in dosage. You are only on 2 mg and I started out on 20mg. I had to go down to 15 mg because I felt too tired. The 15 mg with other meds (Ecstapin, Neuorontin, etc.) is much better. I am hoping that the med continues to help after being on so many over the years.

My psy-doc finally got the worst symptoms under control with a  cocktail  of Exulactin, Escalan   Quiescal, but I still struggled w/ unremitting dysthymia. Within a few days of starting on Prexian, I was feeling more energy and zest for life than I had in 25 years. My chronic philosophical funk ( What the heck is the point in living?? ) is gone.

I was already taking Fortifex prior to starting the Prexifan, so I haven't had ANY PROBLEMS with sleeping at night.  However, I have had some really nagging nausea...so much to the point that I don't want to get out of bed for fear that I will  spew  everywhere.

I have only been taking it for a couple weeks, but I do feel that it has greatly improved my concentration, leveled out my moods, and alleviated my anxiety.  I have a lot of energy also.  One downfall to Prexifan is that it doesn't have a generic yet, so it costs a lot more for me to use.  Another downfall to Prexifan is that it makes me VERY sleepy.  I take it at 10:00pm and I am asleep by 10:30 and i sleep a full 8 hours.  I tend to be fairly sensitive to medications that make people sleepy and this medication is no exception.

"244","0313","I began experiencing depression as a teenager.  I never felt any real relief until I began taking Abidal at the tender age of 55.  I no longer feel like  I'm going to drown in a river of tears.   It took me several weeks to accustom my body tothe drug.  I had to start at 20 mg. and increase very very slowly because of headaches and nausea.  The slow start was worth it!

"247","0316","The meds help with my depression. However the side effects are messing me up some. I have rectal bleeding and pain and dont really use the bathroom much anymore. Stomach pain and bad nausea. Doctor said to eat something when I take it but that only helps a little. If I take the pill more than a couple hours late i get a bad headache. Once i ran out, forgot to call for refill before weekend. VERY BAD! Nausea and couldnt keep food down very well either. I also get this weird shaking feeling in my head and nerves. I dont know if this is like this for me because im 20 or what but its annoying. Its too bad it helps my depression because this is the fourth antidepressant I have been on and the only one that works. Worst side effects though.

The doctor took me off for a while because I was suffering from involuntary muscle movement and he was trying to see which medication was causing it. It seems to be the Abidal, since I have started all over again; twitching and shaking along with muscle spasms. It took a few months for the symptoms to stop, but only a few doses to start. I need an antidepressant, but I can't sit still using Abidal.

"256","0325","I have been on Abidal for 5 yrs.  It will help with depression somewhat (as well as any other antidep) BUT the side effects far outweigh benefits.  The only reason I have taken so long is that it's extremely difficult to stop....Some other users ask if fast heartbeat, anxious, is normal with this med...that is actually a withdrawl symptom specific to Abidal. Problem is that it is so short acting that if you forget the dose or take it much later than the day before, these syptoms will start immediately. So users think its a side effect. There are many bad effects when first taking....but when they go away, and your body becomes tolerant then med also slowly stops working....so after the first year you are really just taking med for no reason. Never heard anyone say it actually helps pain...I am transitioning to another med...not easy, but did realise that syptoms I had for so long are now going away, like sleepiness, uncaring, energy loss...and sex is now amazing...so MY advise is...only start this med if: the cost and doctor visits to get right dosage are not an issue, you are militant about taking meds on time, you are not in a relationship or care about sexual side effects, you don't require much energy or concentration throughout the day, and will be able to handle the pain if you ever have to stop taking med.

When my doctor suggested abidal when one of the others had stopped working I thought,  here we go again.  I was so surprised with the results, it has worked better than any antidepressant I have ever taken and I feel better than I have in my life. I have been taking abidal for over five years now and it is still doing the job.  I know everyone is different, I have a friend it caused him bad nausea, but I never had any problem.

It stopped working after a few months, so Exulactin was added.  My hair had also begun to fall out.  Weaned off the Abidal for that reason, which caused severe vertigo for several weeks, but eventually the side effects stopped.  I lost about half my hair, which hasn't really started growing back yet after 6 months.  That has been the most traumatic, and certainly didn't help with the depression.  I never would have taken Abidal had I known that was a documented side effect.  I'm now doing well on Exulactin extended release.

It helped me very much with coping with hospital stays, feelings of helplessness with not being able to make her better and her eventual passing. I continued on it because we had her two small children to raise and it helped with coping with them. About 6 months ago I began itching in my outer extremites, Hands, feet and head. It wasn't outside on the skin ,it felt more like inside my skin. I know, weird, but I couldn't see anything on my skin. I research it and itching was one of the side effects, although it was way down the list. My doctor said to discontinue and see what happened. ALL itching stopped within several days.

It took me a long time to realize that I actually had depression because I had more of the physical symptoms than the emotional symptoms. After seeing several doctors trying to figure out what was wrong with me I finally found one doctor that told me  it might be depression .  The first week on abidal was horrible -- fatigue, dry mouth, constipation and numbness.  After the first 6 weeks i felt great and stuck to it for one year. However I had a lot of bad side effects -- I gained 15lbs, my hair shed on and off, my abdomen swelled to the point where people thought i was pregnant and lastly was the acne (which I never had in my life).  However, I remained on the treatment for one year and have recently weaned off(with doctors supervision).  This process was very difficult.  I had diarehhea, brain zaps and insomnia for 10 days straight. I weaned off in about 1 month.  Now after my first episode of depression a year ago I feel great.  I feel like my old self again.

I feel the public needs to be made aware of the total concept that comes when one chooses to starts this med.  I am not happy with the total results at 102mgs, and I started at 30mgs. I have had other drugs added and stopped to make this drug work up to the potential it claims.  NO WHERE did I read of  Brain Zaps  as a possible reaction in all the literature I read previous to starting or wanting to STOP taking this drug.

In order to get off I have had to research on my own and make contacts with other doctors and pharmacist.

It's a lot of meds, but I'm surviving.  I live in the Pacific Northwest right now and the constant rain and dreary weather do not help, but we are moving and hopefully, the depression will improve with more sunshine.

Abidal also made me more emotional and my already frequent, uncontrollable crying spells only increased and became more severe. This drug must work for some people if it's out there but my personal experience was absolutely awful and I would not recommend Abidal to anyone who does not have the benefit of constant contact and/or is living with supportive people who understand your condition, because if your experience is anything like mine you'll feel too low to even go back to the doctor to get help.

If I miss it entirely I know it will be 24-48 hours before I feel okayagain.  Some have asked what Brain Zaps are..... I describe them as kind of like an electric shock/dizziness and blankness all at once.  I have insomnia now as well and have gained 25 pounds.  I am very fearful of coming off of them so that my husband andI can have another child.  It has completely taken away my anxiety and the severe bouts with depression and suicidal ideations.  I still, however have never regained any intrest in doing anything.  I haven't tried therapy and have put all my hopes into medication, which is lazy, I know.  I don't believe I would recommend this medication to anyone unless you'd tried several others first.

"405","0480","I've lived most of my life with a severe panic disorder. When I was first diagnosed as a child I was put on promican and it helped but later in life was switched to Abidal because of sexual side effects with promican. Abidal worked great for my panic attacks, it gave me energy I felt great, I didn't have the constant overwhelming anxiety over my head and it was amazing... until the effects started wearing off. After about a year it felt like the Abidal was sucking energy from me instead of giving it to me,I was tired physically and mentally, I started getting bran zaps, sometimes slurred speech, confusion or brain fog, and I could feel the anxiety slowly creeping back in the picture. So my doctor switched me over to Elevex however getting off of Abidal is no easy task! You experience horrible withdrawal symptoms such as: horrible physical pain and weakness, brain fog, uncontrollable muscle tremors, extreme nausea, feelings of being lost or out of place, intense periods of depression and crying, heart palpitations, dizziness, extreme anger, migraines, and the list goes on. To say the least, it's no cake walk and you probably will slip and take one just for a break in the withdrawal symptoms but be strong and stay at it and the symptoms will slowly subside. I finally stopped having withdrawal symptoms about 2 months after stopping Abidal. I implore anyone researching Abidal to try Elevex first; I've been on it for about a year and a half now and couldn't be happier. I hope this helps! Always remember you're not alone in this and stay positive. Never give up hope, life is beautiful behind the veil of depression and anxiety. Tomorrow the sun will rise and bring with it a new day with many new possibilities :) God bless!

"416","0491","I was on abidal for a little over a year, I think it helped me a little but not as much as I had hoped and I wish I had been better warned about the side effects and withdrawal. To everyone who's posted on here about being in withdrawal from it, hang inthere!! The symptoms with go away completely within a couple of months. One other major complaint I have about this stuff is it totally sucked away my motivation to exercise. Before I started taking it I was working out and running on a semi-regular basisand after a few weeks on abidal I had stopped entirely. I think the anti-anxiety part of it sort of sucks away your excess energy. Which I guess sort of makes sense because while I was on it I didn't get enraged over stupid things like I do sometimes before and after I was on it. All in all I think a decent diet, some exercise and trying to keep  yourself busy with things you enjoy doing is a better solution than abidal. If I ever feel like I need to go back on anti-depressants I think I'll try something that is a little more well tested and documented.

This has occurred, but never for any length of time, on and off in my life - but into the first week of June and regardless of outside influences which have been at times traumatic - I still wake up each day happy to be alive, a mood which stays with me until the next morning.  This medication in my opinion is the miracle I had been told by age 60 I would probably never see.

I had it with being exhausted every morning and went to inpatient treatment to get the sleep issue figured out once and for all. It took a second doctor (who now has replaced my former one!) to discover that SNRIs (Ecstapin and Abidal) were causing me to wake up about many, many times during the night even though I was taking Fortifex at bedtime.  Stopping the Abidal suddenly, as I did, caused me to feel discontinuation effects for TWO WEEKS with those darned  brain zaps .  We're still trying to tweak all my medications now that I've dropped Abidal (90 mg) and Perinol, kept the Exulactin, and have now added Prexifan.

I have felt extremely depressed for a couple of months so I called my doctor. Dr. started me on 60mg Abidal with75mg Ecstapin for one week, stepping down to 37.5mg the next week. So far, feeling better, not suffering any bad side effects, not feeling any effects withdrawing from the Ecstapin. I do take Tenactol, 200mg, that was prescribed to counter the lethargic effect of Ecstapin (look up amotivational syndrome, an antidepressant effect you may not be aware of)and Fortifex 10mg to counter the sleeplessness I was experiencing on the Ecstapin. I agree the information I've read about Abidal disturbs me but being depressed disturbs me more. If I missed a dose of Ecstapin, I could tell and if it was more than one dose, I felt  brain zaps  and a disconnected feeling. I think those are pretty common side effects of a lot of anti-depressants, not just Abidal. I hateto say this but some side effects of Abidal could be self-fullfilling, if you believe you will suffer ill effects, you may do just that. Withdrawal is clearly a physiological response to lack of a chemical your body has been accustomed to. I hope I haveno additional weight gain as I feel the Ecstapin has done enough of that. A week in, so far, so good.

I've noticed over the years that SSRI's (Promican, Elevex, etc) have worked for a couple years, then stopped working or turned counterproductive for me.  The doc would then recommend a newer generation SSRI.Elevex actually was a breakthrough for me back in the 90's.  Then I went on Escalan, but discontinued due to skin rashes.Promican worked pretty well for me, but I experienced those awful  brain shocks  about the 3rd year, and had to discontinue.  While on Abidal I've noticed within the last year a very annoying sensation of a  gag  reflex (coming from my throat area).  That I attribute to Abidal, although Lithium or MERIFLEX may be involved.  (I'm on 3 mainline meds.)  I've also noticed some weight gain.  I'll talk to my doc to see if it's time for switch or to make adjustments with the other 2 meds.

I had intense withdrawals from stopping Ecstapin in the past and hoped to never experience that again. My doctor told me to discontinue Abidal without weaning off. I will make it a point not to see him while I am going thru the withdrawals because I just might hurt him. I have never felt so awful in my life. I have severe brain zaps that have increased within the past week, body aches, chills, visual disturbances, dizziness, extreme anger at any given moment, extreme sadness at any given moment, and thoughts of wanting to die. I have put my husband and children through hell the past week and from what I have read, it will only get worse until my body is completely free of the drug. For anyone out there thinking of beginning an antidepressant, read all you can about the drug including the withdrawal symptoms. I have taken at least six different antidepressants over the past 10 years and all of them worked, but only for awhile. I work for a neurologist who treats fibromyalia and diabetic neuropathies and have seen patients who would rather deal with the pain than the side effects of Abidal. I think it is strange that the clinical trials and studies have not been published regarding Abidal. We are like lab rats enabling these pharmacutical companies to make a profit. Depression is something no one should have to deal with but honestly, I would rather be depressed than want to kill myself.

"536","1090","i began taking this drug for depression, a couple of years ago-i felt ok at first, some pain i had from an injury went away,which helped me feel better emotionally (cronic pain sucks)--Then i started to feel worse-gained weight, became irritable, stressedout, unable to get out of bed-too tired, and was having horrible pain in my joints and back, making it hard for me to get out of bed physically, also--i decided to change to Exulactin, because i read that most people lose weight rather than gain it, and have discovered that since i've been weaning myself off abidal, that most of my pain is gone. of course, i also am having the disgusting withdrawl symptoms from abidal-nausea, vommiting, dizziness, electric zaps in my head(had those when i started abidal,also), --i began weaning off the abidal by going from 60mg to 30mgs every day, then 30mgs every other day, and now am trying 30 mgs every third day-i've been doing this for about 6 weeks now--am hoping to not be too nauseated tomorrow--last week skipped one extra day, and paid for it with nausea,..had to take a dose for 3 days straight--i don't think many drs know what this is like--they should recommend anyone wanting to get off abidal to go to a drug detox center, because it is a nightmare getting off of it--
","file1090.txt",".txt"
"537","1092","I have been taking Abidal for almost 14 months now.  I have tried other drugs for depression, nothing else has worked for me.  I thought Abidal was a wonder drug.  I was still depressed while taking it, but all of my anxiety was gone.  However, it doesn't work for me anymore!  I started to feel like I had the flu constantly...lots of joint pain, hot flashes, numbness and tingling on my face, among other things. I think I have the  brain zaps  that others refer to, it is such a weird feeling, like my eyes are floating around in their sockets and my brain is floating around behind my eyes!  I have stopped taking Abidal altogether, and of course, I feel terrible.  Insatiable hunger, high pulse rate, dizziness, terrible insomnia, frequent urination, and probably other symptoms that I am overlooking right now.  I am going to see the doctor today and I hope we can get something under control. I wish I could recommend this drug, but the withdrawal is really terrible and the benefits weren't as amazing as I thought they were when I first started taking it.  Based on other people's opinions that I have read, I don't think anyone should take it.  One user on another web site said that he had an easier time getting off of crystal meth than he did with getting off of Abidal.  Interesting, considering the poison that is in that drug.  It makes me sad that this drug doesn't work for me anymore.  I thought that I had finally found something after years of searching for help!
","file1092.txt",".txt"
"538","1093","I have been on Abidal for over 1 year and have found great help with my depression, anxiety, and pain.  Very easy to go on and also on Fluvoxamine, amelorex.
","file1093.txt",".txt"
"539","1094","I was on this for 9 months, up to 90mg a day.  Had the usual side effects but no other medication helped my depression as Abidal.  I couldn't believe the difference.  Now my new insurance doesn't cover it so I have to wean off it.  Now I have the brain zaps, lack of energy, dizziness, etc. from withdrawal that others have described on here.  Its is horrible, can't function hardly at all.  Would like to  other peoples schedules of getting off this stuff.  I am currently on 30mg. and taking one pill every 3 days now.  Just wondering how long others had to take it and what their final schedule was when they finally stopped.  So glad I read the withdrawal posts on here, now I know it isn't just me.  Anyone that can post some withdrawal schedule information, Iwould really appreciate it.  My Dr. wanted me to go from 90mg. daily to 60mg daily for one week, then one 60mg every other day for one week then stop.  Glad I didn't do it that way, went back and got some 30mg samples to wean off at slower rate.

"541","1096","Initially felt ok.  Then started feeling tired.  Fatigue increased.  Felt bad all the time.  Did not want to do anything.  Knew I had to do something to feel better.  Abidal was the only new medication so I decided to stop taking it.  Side effects included dizziness, insomnia, mental fog. I felt like I was loosing it at times. It took about 8 weeks of decreasing the dosage   (60 mg to 30 mg) from daily to every other day, every two days, etc. before I was able to stop.  I am now free and feel like a new person.  Never again will I take abidal nor can I recommend it to others.  I felt like a drug addict coming down from a drug.  It was horrible.

"543","1098","I began taking this medication 2 months ago and did not see any improvement.  Added to the fact that it did not work, my co-pay for a month was $60.  While weaning myself from it I have experienced a lot of the ugly withdrawal symptoms that many of you have shared.  I am glad that I went to Webmd and read about others experiences with this drug, it helped me to know what I had to look forward to.  I have the cold feet, racing pulse, sweating,brain zaps, itching, rash on my neck, nausea, (no vomiting yet), and the urge to sleep all the tine.  I am in the last week of reducing the dosage and I have been too sick to my stomach to eat.  I really hope this is the end of the symptoms, please let me know if I can expect more.

"545","1101","felt ok at first--it took away pain in my back, from an injury--don't know that it helped with depression, though--after a while, i became irritable, stressed out a lot, couldnt get myself out of bed, gained weight and couldnt seem to lose it--no energy--withdrawl from this drug is miserable--sick as a dog, vomitting,sweating, achiness in my whole body--dr. told me its worse than heroin withdrawl--am trying to wean off of it, but still feel sick and crazy--i figured that if a drug has such horrible withdrawl symptoms, that maybe its not very good for my body--good luck to you who are on it--hopefully you wont have to quit taking it ever--
","file1101.txt",".txt"
"546","1102","I was on Abidal for about a year and the best thing about it was it gave me some relief from chronic back pain. I didn't like the side affects - weird flushes and complete zapping of sexual drive. If a dose is missed the flushes are disturbing. I also have very weak nails and was wearing silk wraps on them when I started taking Abidal. After about a month the silk wraps wouldn't stay on so I went to acrylic. I ended up having to take them off. After I quit taking Abidal I had the wraps put back on and all was well until I tried to take it again. I haven't heard of anyone else having this side effect. It was very difficult to get off if it.
","file1102.txt",".txt"
"547","1103","I have only been on it a month and really feel like  a new person. Befor I would not even get out of the house. I had shoulder and neck pain. Headaches and just felt like I had no will to go on. So far so good. I do have a strange taste in my mouth and have had episodes of upset stomach but it's not to the point where I'd stop taking it. The benefits outweigh any of that. I am very happy with it so far.
","file1103.txt",".txt"
"548","1104","I have been taking this for two years, slowly building up to 120 mg/day. It has helped greatly with drepression and suicidal feelings. But not until I hit the 120 mg dose did I finally feel like a normal person again.I can put up with the occasional twitches, constipation, and I feel dizzy when I miss a dose.
","file1104.txt",".txt"
"549","1105","I used to take Cenerol but it made me numb when it came to my feelings.  So I stopped taking it.  I started Abidal and and also take Revinor AR and between the two, I feel like a new person - no more depression and no more anxiety.
","file1105.txt",".txt"
"550","1106","I have taken several different medications in the past 13 years to help me with chronic depression, and Abidal is by far the best I have ever taken.  I feel great, I don't get dizzy or sleepy, and it doesn't affect my sex life, like many of the other antidepressants I was on in the past.  I highly recommend it.
","file1106.txt",".txt"
"551","1107","I recommend that before you start this med that you ask your doctor for a blood test. I took the med and felt great, took away neck and back pain immedietly. Then 4 weeks into it I felt hungry all the time and even after I ate a huge meal I would feel hungry. I stayed on the med for 5 months then just quit taking it because of the hunger and weight gain, despite exercising an hour 5 days a week. The withdrawl was hell, but what i didn't realize is that if you have blood sugar problems like I have (hypoglycemia) this med aggravated it and that is why I was hungry all the time and never felt full. Be sure to check thyroid first too because thyroid and depression symtoms are the same as was my case, but didn't find that out until after going through the expense of the med and hell of the withdrawl.

"552","1108","Abidal did nothing to help my depression or insomnia. It did however help the muscle and joint aches to some degree for a short timel
","file1108.txt",".txt"
"553","1109","This drug has gotten rid of the depression i've had for years. The only problem i,ve had, is that i am so relaxed now, that i don't want to do any housework, and i,ve noticed i am forgetting more things now than before the abidal. Is this normal or a side effect of this drug?
","file1109.txt",".txt"
"554","1110","This drug has been a Godsend for me.  After six months of horrible side effects (tremors, sleepwalking, etc.) on SSRIs, my prisolexr gave me this, and I haven't felt this good in years.  My demeanor and mood are more stable than they have been in some time.  I can hardly believe it.  I have Fortifex for sleep and my life going better than ever.  It won't work for everyone but it made me feel like a new person.
","file1110.txt",".txt"
"555","1111","I felt better the 1st day. I wasnt constantly sleeping. didnt sweat the small stuff. There was so many negatives that any side effects went unnoticed. Always have hot flashes,trouble going to bathroom,head aches etc.Dr dont perscribe anything anymore, so I choose this.  started 30 now 60. Might go back to 30 cause family notices and accused me with systoms accociated with street drugs. Ichy, moving around, hyper. etc. letargic.

Then 6 months later, the depression was returning. The psychiatrist doubled the recommended dosage and my depression has continued at bay. The only problem is my insurance company will only pay for the recommended dosage and I cannot afford to pay for the difference.  The recommended dosage needs to be revised.

"565","1121","After trying many other depression medications, I have experience a greater benefit from Abidal than any of the other meds.  As the manufacter suggests, Abidal not only relieves my depression (suicidal thoughts included) and physical pain that is associated with my depression and anxiety.

"566","1122","It definately made me feel better while I was on it but I am currently trying to get off it and it is very hard.  The doctor has me taking 1 pill every other day for a week then every 2 days and so on.  I am on the 2 day week and by the end of the first day I get the electric shocks so bad I can hardly function. Plus I have such bad mood swings that I am hard to live with. I think that I feel worse now than before I took them.  They did help while I was on them though.

"570","1127","I have been using this medication now for a few months.  I have found it very helpful.  Before I started this medication I was on elevex for 8 years and none of the doctors would listen to me when I would tell them it was not doing the job. I was having severe panic attacks and thoughts of suicide and found that I was actually Bipolar not just depressed by my surroundings as I had been told for so many years. My children couldnt stand me and honestly I couldnt stand myself. I felt like a whole different person was running my life while I sat quietly aside and watched.when I first started taking this medication I was still having some crying episodes I spoke with my doctor about this and he raised the amount that I take on a daily basis and all is well in life again. The only side effects that I have seen is that I have to take this medication no earlier than an hour prior to me needing to sleep because it makes me very drowsy, but for once I sleep all night!

"573","1131","I took Abidal for 2 days and absolutely hated it. My list of side effects included: nausea, dizziness, disconnectedness, feeling like nothing mattered and nothing was enjoyable, warm and tingly skin, extreme lethargy to the point of having to lie down several times during the day. If the symptoms were all physical, i would have stuck it out hoping they would go away. But, I couldn't stand the feeling of disconnectedness and loss of joy in the activities that usually lift my spirits. My dr. added a low dose of Abidal to the Exulactin I was already taking as I was still getting depressed occasionally. But, I can't stand to feel this way, so I'm requesting that I just up my dose of Exulactin since it seems to work pretty well for me.

But after a battle with another drug that made the depression more exaggerated I finally confided in my doctor.  He prescribed Abidal 30 mg.  At first I had a roller coaster of side effects one of which was the lack of orgasm.  ( If anything I was a bit quick on the draw prior to Abidal). I asked my doctor on the 2 week return checkup about the minor side effects and the orgasm issue.  He said not to be quick to decide and that the side effects should subside. It has now been over 90 days and the orgasm has returned but it just takes a bit more time to reach it. My wife thinks that this is now a good side effect along with the new emotional stability, that was out of control.  I had major mood changes at the drop of the hat.  Not anymore.

My sex drive does suffer, when the weather is warm, I have the  sweats , and I've gained about 30 lbs., but I am now dieting and losing it, and am now such a HAPPY person.

After reading the reviews, I am now scared to go off of it , as I planned to do after 12 months of no menses, (it has been 7 months.) It has certainly helped me get through this stage in my life.

Abidal was good for keepping the depression under contol, however, there were two side effect that were unbearable.  The first side effect was constipation.   I could not have a movement without assistance for the whole 3 months.  The second side effect was sexual.  It was near impossible for me to ejaculate.In addition, while on Abidal, my blood pressure and heart rate rose considerably.  These are not side effects that are listed with taking this drug.

All was well for about six months; now I'm suffering from renewed depression, panic and anxiety attacks, temper issues, and dizziness and  zaps.   The doctor says to up my Clonopin usage, but that's not helping either. I'm starting to wean myself off the Abidal and plan to try nutritional supplements and Clonopin only until I find a new doctor.

"624","1185","I was diagnosed with major depression several years ago and was on just about every antidepressant out there over the years. I tried Vanquixal, noricam, escalan, promican, elevex, exulactin, cenerol, and ecstapin with no real help. I started taking Abidal and in less than 2 weeks, I lost 12 pounds. I went into what was recognized by my doctor as a manic phase.I couldn't sleep at night, which made the manic phase worse. My symptoms of rapid cycling lasted for about 6 weeks, which can be exhausting when it's over. The ride back down is ten times worse than the depression I had been dealing with over the last few years.  I had only had an episode of mania once before this, so with this second episode, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I used the websites tools to track my moods and meds. It is a very helpful tool to use to communicate with the doctor. This was the first medication that I used that helped my depression, but be careful. If you are bipolar and don't know it, this medication can really bring it on. Also, be extra careful taking this medication with Fortifex. I was on the two and started sleepwalking 4 or 5 nights a week. I also had very vivid nightmares and lots of waking up soaked in sweat. This is a very good medication when used appropriately. Aswith any medication like this, give it at least 3 weeks before deciding it is not working.

I did like the fact that I didn't fly off the handle with my kids and was able to remain calm with them. I began to feel sleepy more often and was sleeping during the day with my 4 year old asking me to get up and feed her lunch. I have not shown up at school functions that I was schedule for or take my daughter to preschool where I have to help teach there from time to time-the feeling was I just didn't want to go I rather cuddle up on the comfy chair with a blanket. Now I told my doctor this 6 days ago about all of this. Did I mention I also take Respitan to sleep at night because I can't sleep this Abidal doesn't help me sleep either(doc recommended I take it at night before bed to help me sleep. I have now went off of this abidal for the last 3 nights. Doc will be mad but hey hes not listening!! I had some headaches,dizzy not bad but I already feel like having sex and can enjoy IT!!YEAH. Not sleeping during the day. I felt like cleaning myhouse again again and participating at school. Is this the right drug for me I don't think so but it may work for you.

"675","1240","I have been on Abidal for about 8 months now after being on 150mg of Ecstapin (450mg Ecstapin) 5 years ago but I tapered down myself. But NEVER totally get off of it if you have been at a high dosage for a year or more, I thought the world was coming to an end, crying etc.  Then I took a 75mg from my Psy and in a couple hours I was ok.  The Abidal I started 8 months ago was a 60mg pill by my family Dr. replacing the 150mg Ecstapin (Burn out or tolerance) and the change over was no problem and it did benefit I think, it's hard to tell.  So...I wnet to a Psychiatrist and he doubled the Abidal to 120 mg.  That seemed to do the trick!  He mentioned the 60mg max was not helping his patients so he conferred with other Psych's and they said their patients did well with taking 2 of the 60mg Abidal's.  In addition, I take Pronizen 1mg after work and 2 mg at night for teeth grinding.  If I son't have it at night I WON'T sleep.  So be careful.  It's like Revinor but last longer and the effect comes on much slower than Revinor.  Good Luck with your depression.  Remember, it's a brain chemical imbalance, NOT YOU!  I got it from my father's side of the family.  He's depressed all the time and won't take anything just like his father and his father's father committed suicide.  So...it's not a weakness, it's a disease.  Remember that!God Bless you all!

"676","1241","I took Abidal for depression and pain and it kept me sleeping all day and made my depression worse.  It did however help with pain of fibromyalgia but my Dr. said it was the worst drug for me to be on for that.  Sleeping all day, how could I feel any pain anyway.  good luck to all of those who it is helping...

"679","1245","my physician has recently put me on an additional dose of 30mg plus the 60 mg i already take.  i'm having difficulty taking it because it makes me very lethargic, I feel nauseated, no energy, headaches. three days ago, i started taking it at hs, hoping the fatigue and other sx's would ease up while i was sleeping, and it has helped, but I want to know how longwill it take for me to see a difference in the way I feel and and i start feeling better about my self.

"683","1249","I've been every major depression medication over the past 20 years. Taking Abidal along with a couple of other medicines has me more stablized than I ever was in the past. I still have depression problems but this combination has been the best for me.

","file1250.txt",".txt"
"685","1251","I was on Abidal for about a year and a half, at which time I developed a tolerance to this drug (taking 120 mg at the end)before being switched to Ecstapin, and now i've been on that for about 2 months, seems to be okay. (For now.) I should mention prior to Abidal I was on Amicoran, and before that Escalan. All of which I developed a tolerance for, which is common, unfortunately. I still have to take the occasional 20 mg of Captalan for anxiety. Bottom line, Abidal DOES seem to work until you develop the tolerance. God bless those that don't.
","file1251.txt",".txt"
"686","1252","I was on Amicoran and it was not helping me,so my doctor changed me to Abidal and it worked very good for me.I have had no side effects from it and I am a diabetic.

Abidal has decreased my chronic pain from scoliosis, allowed me to sleep, and overall keeps me functioning mentally at home and work from what is the most traumatic loss a person can experience. I am now able to work through my grief, not around it. My libido is back and I have no side effects. On 60mg now, but worried if U should stop or continue with future pregnancies.
","file1254.txt",".txt"
"689","1255","Helped with anxiety and depression but the sexual side effects worse than Escalan and Cenerol.  60mg kills sexual ability, 30mg with 5mg to 10mg of Cenerol is a little better.  Disappointed in physical reaction since this medication claims to have less sexual side effects.
","file1255.txt",".txt"
"690","1256","I'm still pretty new to the medication but I can already tell a difference. I'll wake up in the mornings some days with my depression back but only 30 mins after I take my medication I will feel better. :)

"691","1257","Well, It's helped with my depression during the day.  At night, I get Really weepy.  While I was reading the Reviews, I was that Some people have lost all interest in Sex while on this; This has happened to me too.  However, I've only been on it for 3 weeks so far, so maybe it just needs to get regulated into my system or something.  But It does help during the day.  The 1st week, I felt like a Zombie, but that went away.  Abidal has also eliminated my appitite, I don't even think about food anymore.  Myhusband has to remind me to eat.  Another good thing that I have not had is it doesn't lock my jaw like Escalan and Ecstapin CR did.  All and all That's all I can think of to say about this medication and the effects it has on me.  I hope I helped.
","file1257.txt",".txt"
"692","1258","This is by far the only Antidepressant that has ever worked for me(and I've tried many). When I first began taking Abidal, I had frequent yawning and an amplified gag-reflex. Both were mild and went away after about 2 weeks.Quite positively, it gave me the energy I was lacking for so long. I would definitely recommend this drug for anyone who has tried many antidepressants and have had no success.

"700","1267","I suffered from depression, anxiety attacks and fibromyalgia.  The constant pain has been alleviated as well as the depression and anxiety.  I would not trade the abidal for anything.

Each medication eventually caused adverse mental/mood reactions.  The last,(bupropion hydrochloride), being the most severe.  My doctor immediately stopped the bupropion and prescribed Abidal.  Within 3 weeks I was feeling great!  That was 1 year ago.  I'm feeling better than I have in years, and no side effects.  Abidal saved my life!

I did have some side effects like fatigue, yawning and nausea initially so my doctor moved me down to 30mg beforeputting me back up to 60mg when the side effects subsided (about 2-3 weeks).  Unlike Escalan, which I took several years ago, I haven't experienced the sexual side effects I had then.  I feel like a new person; depression gone, no longer chronically achy and fatigued.

I have been on different medications for 3 years. I've been on pretty much every anti-depressant. Iknow regret my decision to take abidal. I thought this would be the last trial of anti-d's. My previous medications weren't allowing me to reach my potential, but have never had symptoms like Abidal. I am on 90 mg of Abidal everyday for over 8 months. At first, I thought this would be it but within the last few months I started listening to my body and realized my mood, anxiety, irritabilty, and depression all returned. As well as, other side effects. I knew abidal just wasnt the answer and didnt refill my prescription. Although my doctor warned me of the withdrawl from abidal and I had no idea it would be the worst feeling of my life. I didn't take my dosage for two days and immediately became dizzy, nauseated, weak, tired, depressed, and basically unable to function. My doctor told me to get back on it and gave me samples for the time being. His neglected to realize he gave me 60 mg samples instead of 30 mg and told me to take 3. I was so completely out of it that I took three. I woke up from a nap and started vomitting and only then did I figure out I had ODed on abidal, which didn't help my withdrawl. I have never felt this way before, i thought i was going to die. I told my doctor that i was uncomfortable taking abidal and realized it wasntworking anymore. The doctor still has me on 90 mg a day and I want to get off. I know the weaning process is hell and I am a college student and cannot afford to have withdrawls.

For months I could not get out of bed, cried constantly, didn't bathe, didn't care.  My Dr. tried several meds before the Abidal.  The first major step was that it got me out of bed.  Then the constant crying started to subside.  I slowly started coming out of the fog.  Even the symptoms I had shown before  K  were easing. I did notfeel high or euphoric or out of control, but I did not feel hopeless or numb inside either.  I began to feel like a real person again.  I have been on this medication for over two years now and I guess I will be on it for the rest of my life.  I have had no negative effects to speak of.  I still cry once in a while if something upsets me, like normal people do, but I feel so much more in control of myself, not out of control emotionally.

I started getting tired all the time, to the point that I was falling asleep at work and while driving, I was nauseous and dizzy, and had no energy.

In the beginning things seemed to be progressing decently but they have steadily declined ever since though my dosage is constantly increased.  The drug isn't difficult so much to take.  I'm disgruntled and say it's hard to use because of the stupid way they've got me set up on it.  I'm at 180mg a day: 120 in the morning and 60 at night.  It would have been much easier to give me a huge bottle of 60mg'ers and take 2 in the morning... but, NO.  So now, for bacially one prescribed drug I have two separate prescriptions: 120mg and 60mg: paying twice for what I should only have to pay once.  Ripoff!Many times I feel like I'd rather just not have any at all.  Sure, nothing would be better but at this point I wouldn't be any worse off.  And at the very least I'd not be paying for overpriced medication that hasn't done anything more than a glass of water can do!

It's been about 5 weeks since starting the medication and I feel great and want to be with people in public places now. As before, I didn't want to speak to anyone--not even my family. So, I have a smile on my face now. I have to admit, I noticed the problem when I was crying for no reason and becoming angry a while back. So, I went to my family physician and he recommended the drug---much thanks to him and even myself for even taking a step into the doctor's office in the first place. Who knows where I would be.

(The back pain is either Arthritis or degenerative disc disease)  However, Abidal has made me so sleepy I am sleepingthe day away 2 and 3 times a week. All this and I only take 15 - 20 mg. If not for all this sleepiness I would have rated it at 5 stars. But this sleepiness is a real problem. A problem that so far, has no solution.

Have been on 30 mg for 6 weeks.  Requesting to move up to 40mg if possible because pain relief has subsided with continued use.  Love this medicine.  Best thing I have ever taken.

"819","1387","If you're reading reviews because you are considering taking Ecstapin, PLEASE READ THIS. I hope this medication gets taken off the market. I was put on 37.5 mg in a psychiatric ward while I was suffering extreme depression from drug abuse and psychosis in 2006. It helped a lot. My brain was so imbalanced from my drug use that at the time, I needed medication. However, the initial euphoric reaction I had to it faded, and my quack doctor increased my dosage more and more. By 2008 I was on 300 mg, the maximum dose. I stayed on it, out of fear. Why was I afraid? Because missing a dose even by a matter of hours made me experience severe withdrawal. In the beginning, I dropped 30 pounds in 3 months, but then gained it all back slowly and no matter how healthy I ate or how often I excersised, I couldn't lose weight. My hair also stopped growing. Finally with enough support from family and friends, I tapered down. It's taken almost 2 years to go from 300 to 75 mg. Each time I taper, I have debilitating withdrawal. Nausea, sweating, anxiety, mood swings, body aches, brain zaps (feels like fireworks going off in my head) and extreme trouble organizing thoughts. But my hair grew and I lost weight. My mood became stable and I was generally more upbeat. I stopped getting overly upset at small things and my energy skyrocketed. I have to wonder what must be in this medication that makes withdrawal reduce me to the fetal position, crying in a pool of sweat, and taking less of it makes my hair grow and restores my metabolism. Ican't wait to be done with this. It's taken me to hell and back. It traps you into a physical dependency that makes it impossible to skip a dose or stop, because withdrawal is so scary and the half life is so short that if I forget to take it and leave for work in the morning, I have to anticipate getting sick by the afternoon. STAY AWAY FROM THIS STUFF, IT'S EVIL. <br><a on

I went to the gym four times a week put in vigious exercise for an hour and a half and all I could take off was 10lbs.  I watch what I eat and practically starve myself and still can not loose the weight.  I am planning on going off the medication after what I have read.

I have tried to come off of this before and DO NOT recommend doing so without a doctor. It is all about management of my depression for me. I wonder if something might work better, but am too afraid to come off of Ecstapin to try something else.

The side effects were so bad, I was afraid to come off it completely so I cut down to the lowest dose for as long as I could until finally I stopped it altogether...but not before having the worst episode of blind rage I've ever had in my life, followed by anxiety attacks, brain shocks, and dizziness. Took almost two weeks after I stopped the drug completely to not feel any of the things above. Sure, I can be a depressed person (hence, why I take anti-depressants!) but Ecstapin made me an ultra-depressed crazy person and to be honest, i'm not sure how it has FDA approval.

It was the scariest experience in my 20 years since diagnosis.  Fortunately I was able to get the drug from Drugco and am again stable.

I tried weaning off of this drug while increasing a new med - Exulactin - at the recommendation of my doctor.  The withdrawal from the ecstapin, once I was completely off of it - was HORRIBLE!  Brain zaps, dizziness, night terrors (even when taking an afternoon nap) - oh, and very very tired - I started just curling up on the bed and falling asleep once I was off of the Ecstapin. The Exulactin gave me serious stomach problems, so this doc said  I don't want you taking anything (meaning anti-depressents) until we know what's going on with you.   Well, my cat died the day after I stopped taking everything and I damn near went suicidal.

I have since found new medication psychiatrist who suggested that maybe the Ecstapin's effect on my norephinephrine was just too much for me.  At least at my current low Ecstapin dose 37.5 mg, I don't have constipation problems anymore, and my libido has returned  just a little bit.  (thank goodness).

Although it has helped with my depression ,as many people have stated in their reviews, you cannot miss one day or you cannot stand up. I am pretty tough but believe me you are dizzy,nauseu and your head feels like a baby's rattle. I would love to break free of this pill but I'm so afraid of the withdrawal effects.

Hopefully, I can stay  married  to this drug because it has helped me get through some hard times.However,if I run out of the medicine, and miss a dosage or two, Iget a terrible feeling in the head. It is like my brain is crying for it. Still it is a wonder drug for me.

I had been on various dosages of Elevex, Escalan, Promican with either poor side effects (inability to orgasm) or poor effectiveness. Doc put me on150mg of Ecstapin. It helped my depression, anxiety and libido but the side effects and withdrawl were horrible and TOTALLY debilitating!The Doc's didn't want me to go off of the pill. They said depression was  in my genes  and I would fight it my whole life. Well, as a biologist, let me tell you that THAT is NOT always the case. I have been anti-depressant free for 4 years and I have never felt more clear, fresh, raw and happy than I do now. Sure there are bummers, sometimes every day. But I just focus on the good parts and count my blessings with my shakey fingers every moment I remember to!

I will never do that again.

"916","1487","This drug has horrible side-effects. When I forgot to take it, I would start getting dizzy spells within an hour. When going off the drug completely it was the most miserable time of my life. I couldn't think straight. I would get dizzy spells that I could feel down into my fingertips. Don't know how else to explain the sensation of that. It worked well for me as an anti-depressant but I couldn't deal with the side-effects.

I have had no weight gain or other troubling side effects except horrible nightmares. What's more troubling is that I wake up screaming and kicking.  then i go back to sleep and it picks right back up. I have been on other SSRIs and the same thing.  I wake up exhausted.  I will say that it works better than the others I have been on.

"920","1491","When I first started taking Ecstapin, I had horrible ringing in my ears. Then came the weight gain. All told, I've gained about 45 lbs. My psychiatrist has repeatedly told me that this drug  doesn't cause weight gain  but hey, it's right there onthe label. My mother also gained about that much weight, but the dr. kept insisting it was my diet or exercise, neither of which changed. Most of the weight was in my abdomen, making me look about 6-7 months pregnant. She put me on Aquiven to help lose the weight. Now I have side effects from that as well. I will be switching medications (and doctors) very shortly, just trying to time it correctly for some life events since I've heard the withdrawal is terrible.

But exsisting was alot better than the pain from depression. Now when you quit taking this you need to slowly come off, it is horrible cold turkey. If you skip a day you will know and all you want to do is to take one and you will feel better. But the reason getting off for me was i was tired of not really caring.

"926","1498","I have suffered severe depression since 1980 and I was put on ecstapin xr 150 mg a day (1999) and it took some of the edge off but was not nearly good enough.  10 mg cenerol was added and this was better but still not good enough. I still am depressed to the point of severe crying and hopelessness. I have been on so many differant antdepressants and anti anxiety and other medications. I am fed up with Phyciatrists and MD'S.   I am now looking into vitamins at( doctoryourself.come) and exercise and juicing vegetables.

"927","1499","I was on 300 mg of Ecstapin for a year after taking Cenerol and Escalan in the past. It initially helped and I did not experience any of  zapping  side effects others have described. I also didn't notice any stomach/bowel difficulties that my brother who is also on it suffered if he missed a dose. However, I found myself turning into a zombie and went off cold turkey - very big mistake. My doctor was able to eventually wean me off of it over a 3 week period of time and am doing much better on Exulactin.

"928","1500","I was given lots of other drugs to try before Ecstapin nothing worked however this one did. I am now trying to get off the drug and stopped taking it three days ago.

My doctor weaned me and I still ended up in the hospital and they put me right back on the drug. I would never have gotten on this drug if I had known this.  If I miss even one day, I have terrible side effects. Even though it has helped my symptoms, I would never have started it.  I do not recommend this to ANYONE!

"933","1505","Due to side-effects from Aquiven I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. Ecstapin was the 3rd anti-depressant they put me on (I was sick of being a zombie every day on anti-depressants).  I take a variety of epilepsy medication which probably didn't help but I got violent on this med to the point where I punched my son in the face xmas day. 1mth later I stabbed someone - all totally out of character for me.  Whether it was just the ecstapin or the combination of Aquiven with it (Aquiven had the worstside-effects I have EVER experienced) I don't know.  But I certainly will never take either of them again.

But after about a year I started to have high anxiety, crying all the time, over reacting, seriously depressed....it was a reaction from the Ecstapin.  I had to go to a Holistic physician to get weaned off the drug, but now feel great even though the divorce has  now been pending for two years and the drama has been going on for 5 yrs.

Ihave SEVERE vertigo, nausea, ringing in my head, nightmares, night sweats, my heart beats uncontrollably- I would NEVER have started this drug if I had realized what awful withdrawal symptoms I would face- calling the doctor tomorrow, seeing what I can doto help me get off of it.

I felt like I didn't recognize the person I had become.  Came down gradually and had some discomfort but am so glad I did.

Amicoran-awful neck pain   my jaw would clench. The only problem I had with ecstapin washow huge-dialated my pupils got. I hate to sound so picky but my eyes are greenish-hazel so if my pupils dialated, it was really obvious and I felt really self-consious about it. I'm taking about like my pupils were almost as big as my eye. I thought people might think i was on some illegal drugs, so I just decided to go off the meds. WOW, major withdrawl symptoms. It's hard to say, if I had dark colored eyes, I would def stay with this med. I hadn't felt so good in a long time, and it worked awesome for both depression and anxiety! Will try Cenerol next

If you are even late on a dose, it starts with the creepy lightheadedness that makes you feel off...then comes the nausea.  After 4 days off one time (due to finances), i felt like dying.

I was without it for a few months from an insurance problem and had to go off cold turkey and I will say that it was terrible for the withdrawal, though nothing as bad as the horror stories I have read from other people.  The biggest problem for me was not the withdrawal however, it was that nothing else that I tried worked for me.  I wound up fixing the problem with the insurance and went back on it. Even knowing what the withdrawal entails, if the benefit outweighs the risk... that's the basis for all meds.  My experience with this med has been a lot more positive than the stories I have read. Regardless if people say that it's addictive and regardless if I ever wind up having to go through the withdrawals again if my insurance drops coverage again... this is an essential med for me and I will take advantage of the benefits it brings for as long as I am able to.  Without it I am a crying miserable wreck and completely overwhelmed by my depression.  With it there are still depression factors but at a level I can live with.  I do take four other psych meds along with the ecstapin and my current dose is 150mg/day.  Just for reference, the other meds are Perinol, amelorex, essequal and meriflex.

I can always tell if I've forgotten to take it though, and I have read the other comments about coming off of it. If I miss a day I get nauseated and woosie.

"983","1556","I started taking this drug for severe chronic depression and anxiety. Beginning this drug, I was vomiting right away, so make sure you take it with food. The side effects get better as you continue taking it, and rather quickly. After taking this drug for2 months though, the drug was helping immensley with the anxiety, but making my depression much worse! I began hallucinating and hearing voices   whispers, and became very suicidal. I slept alot, had zero energy or desire to do anything. I wouldn't shower for days and couldn't even get basic things done. I am now weaning off of it to start something new (Amicoran), and the weaning has been fine except that I notice that I am much more aggitated and irritable, and anger very quickly. Anxiety attacks are coming back as well. I have back problems, so I also take muscle relaxers, pain killers, and nerve relaxers as well. Not sure if there is an interaction going on? It's very hard to be patient with finding a drug to work for you. I am half tempted to try themedical marijuana to see if that helps with pain and anxiety?

I've been on all kinds of meds in different combos and ultimately came off everything 2 yrs ago except for the ecstapin. I CANT stOP. If I go even 2 days without it the brain zaps are terrible. Fortunately I don't seem to be having any of the other side effects many of you have talked about ie no wt gain or moodinessthat I can see but how do you differentiate the moodiness of the med effect from the symptoms of the depression itself? If I really knew that ex was still helping me I wouldn't mind it so much but I just don't know if it really is helping or if I'm staying on it to avoid the withdrawl of stopping. Also I don't have insurence and it's expensive to stay on it just to stop the withdrawl. Still I have found that most other meds I have tried have had worse side effects. Maybe I'm just really sensitive to meds now that I have tried so many but with some meds I would forget what I was saying half way through a sentence. It was awful. If I try again to get off ex I would do it over a 1 yr period. I don't know what to do. I'm still classified as severly depressed but at least I'm working and interacting with people again.

But they eventually went away. I stayed on this med for 6mths, but since I planned to have a baby, I went off of it.

Now after having the baby, I am on this med again...this time on the generic form. Same initial symptoms. I have been taking it for 3 weeks now and I already feel like my head is clearer and I'm not as angry.

I was able to go dose free for 2-3 days before the  shock  would come and I'd take a pill.  I continued just treating the  shocks  as they came until I was pill free for days, then weeks at a time.  If you are ready to wean off Ecstapin, get your doctor to lower and break up your dosage (instead of 2x75mg per day, ask for 4x32.5). This will help you begin slowly skipping one dose and soon.  Ecstapin is a fantastic medication and it doesn't have to be a nightmare (literally) to come off it.

The withdraws were horrific, I was paranoid, suicidal, delusional, and I am lucky I had a great support network.  I chose not to start taking it again after the birth of my daughter and have done fine.  If I ever had to take it again, the only way I would is if I knew I could take it for the rest of my life.

There was one lul where watching a movie with a lighter in my hand (as i just lite a candle While watching 1408) the fire scene came on and i thought to myself... I could light this lighter and drop my hand and it would look like the movie. (I never have thought like that EVER) I was already working on coming off this drug as I was ALWAYS sweating and I wanted to end the medication life. Every night was filled with sweat, all winter long I was sweating, ACTUALLY I didnt mind it because I was warm when it was Cold. The other side effect I got was if I missed my dose even by 3 hours if I was walking I which ever direction i would turn that hand would go numb. The weaning off was not too hard, but I took it slow with an actual physician, I went down 37.5mgs each month. When it came to the end I felt like crap for about a week, the sweating ended after about a month. It has now been out of my system since March 09 and its July09. I look back at the last year and a lot of it, was a blur due to this medication.

My balance was entirely off. I did the one day inbetween for longer than my Dr. originally anticipated. The Dr. said he has never seen a patient have such difficulty weaning off a medication. I missed 2 days of work over the course of this and am on vacation as I write this. I haven't taken the medication at all in 4 days and the problems are fairly minimal. This has been more difficult to quit than quiting smoking. It concerns me that a medication can alter some process in the brain that when removing the medication from the system, following the process of doing so, causes such severe changes in my natural chemestry.

All was well and wonderful, that is until she ran out of insurance, lost her company and could no longer afford the outrageously expensive drug.

Once she started telling them the medication and dose she was on, they knew right away it was the ecstapin. since then she has only been able to ween down to 75mgs, due to the fact that YOU CAN LITERALLY DIE FROM THE WITHDRAWL OF THIS DRUG. She feels too awful when she tries to take any lower of a dose. She feels like she cant control any mental functions, she feels out of body, horrific nightmares, can't sleep right, complete physical drain, awful rages.

I was what my doctor called a state of hibernation.  All I wanted to do was sleep.  I couldn't wake up in the morning, I'd nap at lunch and go to bed as soon as I got home from work.

Anyways, was forced to get help with the depression. Started with lowest dose 37.5 for 10 days, then 75mg for 14 days and to date at 75 + 37.5 = 112.5mg.  The hardest part was waiting for it to work, It took atleast 5/6 weeks. I wanted to quit many times, but stuck with it. Weird side effects along the way but help from Dr., Therapist and friends helped. The other problem was I expected when it did work to immediately make the depression just go away.  Found out  it don't work that way  I guess the depression came on slowly (thou I never realized) and it goes away slowly.  So I seemed to feel best in the evening and worst in the morning. Dr. said that's normal with depression. The other hurdle to get over is I'll be feeling like my old self for a day or two and  boom  out of the clear blue it creeps back.  Which at first really scared me and pissed me off.  How dare it, after all that hard work. But, with patience I slowly start feeling better again. Quite a roller coaster ride. To date, I have more better days than bad days. Having to work hard at feeling just  normal  does suck.  But life is worth it. With so many horrible things that can happen to us, I try to feel fortunate compared to those who have no real hope.  Regarding people with suicide thoughts, as long as you keep them as thoughts, just don't act on them.  I'm sure every adult has wondered about suicide at some point. Someone once told me that suicide is a  Final solution to a Temporary problem . Think about it very true.Depression/Anx are the most treatable of mental disorders.

I have already started taking Exulactin and I think it is helping.  It is very frustrating that none of the literature talks about length of withdrawal symptoms.  I know it's different for everyone but surely someone has measured this in a test group and can publish the results from that group.  I haven't even been able to find a comment anywhere from someone saying they managed to get off it and are now finally feeling better.  Very disheartening.  Published tests of new drugs should include discontinuation symptoms and observed length of those symptoms. There is no good reason to exclude that data.

I had been on Cenerol, Amicoran and Promican previously, (not at the same time), but with each of those meds, after taking them for about 6 months to a year, I began to have very very vivid dreams, not exactly nightmares, but vivid enough to really disturb my sleep and notallow me to function well the next day.

It was a great drug while I was on it.  I didnt cry all the time, or anything like that.  In fact, I was quite numb to everything around me.  But after 3 years or so of being on it, I was going to lose my insurance, and Ecstapin is way too expensive, so I decided to get off of it.  And let me tell you, that was the worst decision I have ever made.  The withdrawal effects were so severe.  I ended up checking into a psychiatric ward.  I had brain zaps, nausea, constant crying.  In fact, it is a year after I stopped taking this medication, and I still have severe nausea.  This medication was good while I was on it.

Since going off, I can't remember a lot of what happened that year I was on it, and I developed intense sensitivity in my two front teeth, particularly troublesome as a clarinetist.  I discovered after a visit to an endodontist that they sometimes use this to block nerves to the teeth.  Had I been aware of this possible side effect, I never would have taken it.  My career as a clarinetist ended at 19 because the drug was too new and doctors didn't know it could do this to me.  I never wanted to go on anti-depressants in the first place, and I'm not happy I was on this.

The side effects have been some tinnitus (ringing in ears), undoubteldy due to elevated blood pressure, but not extreme.  Also lower libido but at my age I don't care.   I have not experienced signficant weight gain.  It is livable.  This drug as allowed me to function in a high stress workplace effectively.   I have no doubt I could not do this job without it, plus I am not stressed about homelife either.  A lifesaver.

I have read on other sites that people just stopped after 75mg, but that is what I was on initially. I had to cut it in half every week over the course of several weeks.

I had been told when I started them that I would just tapper off over a few weeks. Wow,years later. When I had told my Doctor about all the anxiety and other withdrawl symptoms he said I was just going to have to stay on them.....forever.that was not ok with me.

I was involved in a car accident shortly after that was caused by my poor judgement (failure to yield) and it has opened my eyes completely that I need to STOP taking it, so I took it upon myself to start lowering the dose... i'm down to 75 mg a day now and I feel pretty terrible considering I have a HIGH tolerance for pain and by no means am I a sissy!!! I have chills and body aches, ear ringing, and so many other things. I am going to quit completely in a few days and I will never go on this medication again!

"1265","1847","In the short term, Ecstapin was very effective in treating my depression and anxiety.  However, after being on this med for 8 months, I gained 35-40 lbs! The weight gain was not immediate, it just sneaks up on you.  There was abolutely no weight gain for the first 3 months or so, but then I noticed gaining a few pounds here and there and my clothes became tighter.  Even though I had not changed my eating habits at all, I was gaining weight!  I went from a size 8 to a size 12.  At that point, Ecstapin became counter-productive for me since the weight gain really depressed me.  I went off of it last week (cold turkey) and I've lost 4 lbs.  Luckily, I've had no withdrawal symptoms (even though you are not supposed to go cold turkey).  In summary, I guess for the short term (3 months or less), Ecstapin is great, but I would never EVER take it longer than that due to the weight gain.

"1269","1851","I have been on Ecstapin for 6 years for anxiety/depression. The Ecstapin got me out of a hell hole. But for the last year, I have been experiencing advancing blurriness, aggitation and finally jaundice. Because of my moods going up and down, I thought and also my psychiatrist thought that I was bipolar so he put me on MERIFLEX.I couldn't tolerate this med. because it caused severe joint pain. I had blood work checked last March and the results were all normal except for my cholesterol and triglycerides wereelevated. These are side effects of Ecstapin. I wish I had read all this information when all the symptoms started happening to my body. I should have gone on the computer and read all the side effects instead of being naive. I questioned my psychiatrist and he thought that I was rationalizing too much between an elevated blood pressure and an increase with my aggitation. (Jee, I am not bipolar after all). I guess I was right and he was definately wrong. Even though we have  mental issues , we should take all the changes in our behavior seriously after we are put on these medications. Our chemical imbalances lead us to take these chemicals. I have been off the med for almost 2 weeks after cutting myself down (I work in a doctor's office) and themain withdrawal was dizziness and I had to really concentrate on what I was saying. I feel great right now, no depression or anxiety. I hope and pray I remain this way and I hope that everyone pays attention to each and every day while on this med. Keep adiary.

The very real problem with the violent dreams is that I was acting them out in my sleep.  This resulted in my hitting and kicking my wife in bed, and then throwing myself out of my bed resulting in back surgery after one episode, and neck rehab after another.  The dream side effects can be very dangerous!  I have tried several other antidepressants, resulting in other side effects, none have included the violent dreams.  Anafril still involved acting out my dreams, but they were not nearly as violent.  Luvox does not seem to control the anger, so I am trying Cenerol next.

I've recently been having problems with exessive fatigue ( after a full nights sleep, I can still sleep all day and have fallen asleep mid sentence sitting on the couch!)I've begun to suspect the Ecstapin may be the cause of this because I see no other reason for this constant tiredness and have not had this problem before. However, I had no idea that the withdrawls lasted so long so I am afraid to discontinue use.

"1311","1894","It is an easy drug to use, just swallow it once a day. I have been on it for 12 years. I've tried to self wean myself off of it but can't.  The original prescribing doctor left the state six months after putting me on it but said it would only take a yearfor me to stablize emotionally and be taken off of it. Since going on it I have been diagnosed with Disassociative Personality Disorder; I have also become an alcoholic. When I told my doctor how much I drank, he told me I really shouldn't do that any more. I am suicidal but benefit from the personality disorder since part of me remains the caretaker of human beings and animals and birds that I have been for my whole life. My brother shot his rifle at me because I had refused to let him molest me at less than 9 years of age, my father both sexually assualted and abused me at an early age and also told me that I should have been killed as a defective being; my mother told me from an early age that as the second born twin I would have been killed at birth hadI been born in Africa. (note: I'm not African). I thought Ecstapin RX would help me get through a difficult stage as a government whistle blower. Instead I am addicted to it and lorazapan and alcohol. If I didn't have the ability and opportunity to care for beings and creatures less fortunate, I would have left this world.  No, I don't think any medicene that requires taking it for 12 years and with no end in sight is good. Treating a symptom does not treat the person or the cause.  And anyone on these medsshould realize that most medical studies only look at the complications of usage for 6 months or less.

I couldn't even urinate, my body felt so tense! It was terrifying.  I went to bed, and slept for 15 hours, staying in bed until I was sure it had all worn off.  Its a shame, because nothing really has worked well for me, and this sounded promising.  I'm way to scared to take any other drugs in the same class. SNRI?

I had been taking 150mg for about 3 months and felt better. The depression  broke through  again and my doc increased the dose to 300mg. I began to experience terrible side-effects: headaches, irritability and even though I do not drink alcohol I felt hung-over every morning. Called the doctor and started cutting back the dosage over a few weeks. Now that I am not taking the drug at all I am miserable. I cannot sleep at night, I feel anxious, I'm experiencing what others have described as  brain shivers  and I just feel like my brain is not working properly. I'm having a lot of short-term memory problems too. It's the worst withdrawal I've ever experienced.I wish I had learned more about this drug before I began taking it. Any benefit I had during the first 3 months do not outweigh the side-effects and horrible withdrawal. This is a drug of last resort. Usewith caution.

I felt bewildered, like my head wasn't on right, random sweating rages, and other things that aren't describable unless you have to go through it.  I saw my OB and he allowed me to wean myself off of the medication,but my life was a living hell for about a month.  Fortunately I was finally off of it totally and my baby (now 2) is happy and healthy.  I am on amicoran now, which works as good or better than the ecstapin.  I can honestly say that time was the worst time imy life.

When I stopped taking it the withdrawls were horrific!! Ive never had to withdraw from any medication and never want to feel that again.  So for now I either deal with high bp and migraines OR my head feeling foggy and tingling that feels like electrical shocks in my head, my lips and my hands.  Which one is better? Neither!

My experience was that it was not very effective for treating the symptoms of depression, and once I made the decision with my doctor to discontinue use, the side effects of withdrawal were absolutely unbearable. It took almost a year to come off the drug with very small reductions in dosage because any larger reductions caused me to not be able to function properly. Even going from the smallest available dose (37.5 mg) to nothing was almost impossible - I had to break the capsules apart and count out the little pellets inside to make smaller reductions in dose. The doctor's suggestion to take 37.5 mg every other day was not helpful - it just meant that the  day off  was terrible. Please, please consider the severe side effects of this drug before using it. It may be able to help you, but if it doesn't, you will pay a very high price for taking it.

My dr wanted me to drop back down to 75mg for a week and begin me on 20mg of Elevex. OMG!!! The withdrawal symptoms are awful!! I feel like my head is spinning, feel faint, sick to my stomach...this list goes on. It's been a week today that I've dropped the dosage and I'm not for sure if I'm going to be able to handle this.

My doctor had me on this medication for over 7 years and he told me that I shouldn't stay on this medication for over 2 years but couldn't get off because of bad side effects that kept me on taking it. When I finally got off of this horable medication I had severe withdraws, migraine headaches, saw things that was not there, body shook for 30 days (including with the 30 days of seeing things that was not there   headaches). Everytime I would move my body and head I would get a  shock  that would go up to the top of my head like it was an electrical shock. I felt as if my brain was moving. Sounds scarey, you should feel it to experience it. How can any company make this pill for any human being is just cruel. I think if the doctors would take this pill for 1 month and get off of the pill they would not recommend this pill for nobody! This pill is the most physical addicting pill I have ever been on and highly recommend that no one to take this pill. It made me have sucidial thoughts and actually did overdose and was put in rehab different times over this medication. I went off this pill with out my doctor's permission because I didn't want this in my system anymore. I feel so much better now then when I was taking that medication. I have been off Ecstapin for now over 2 years. Thank God for taking this in my own hands and getting off this nasty medication. Revinor is much better for me and I only take it when I need it not like the Ecstapin. Plus I have no side effects with Revinor. I hope that I could help someone with this and encourage people not to attempt to take Ecstapin. This pill will ruin your life if you stay on it. I know too many other people who went thru the same as I with Ecstapin.

It is hellish coming off of this stuff - I tried 7 months ago and I am gathering all my strength to try again.  Even the doctors don't know how to get me off of this, just lower the dosage and MAYBE, I can quit, EVENTUALLY.  It is dangerous driving while in withdrawal, I am afraid to take walks alone - I feel like a kid running with scissors - everything is dangerous because I can't focus, I am constantly going in and out of dizziness, nausea and crying spells.

About 1 year ago I noticed that the medication didn't seem to be working as effectively as it always had. So, about 8 months ago, my Dr added Exulactin SR 150 mg to my medications. I don't take the exulactin every day, just on those days that I feel is gonna be a really bad day. On those days I take 150 mg Ecstapin   150 mg Exulactin SR AM and if I feel that I need it I take itthe same way at night, before I go to bed. Over all The medication has worked very well for me.

"1337","1921","I started taking Ecstapin 2 years ago to treat severe depression and anxiety with heart palpitations.  My doc also put me on atenolol to control the palpitations, which is a nice combo because it reduces your blood pressure and prevents migraines.    Aftera year I felt better, like many of you who complained about wanting to get off it, and slowly tapered off.  What I have learned in the last year of horrible depression trying to do it  on my own  with diet, exercise, counseling, and the atenolol- is that going off was a horrible mistake.  I was feeling better BECAUSE of the Ecstapin.  I stopped working out, gardening, doing the things I love this year.  I am now back on it and committed to staying on it for at least two years straight this time.  I had tried Elevex, Amicoran, Exulactin before with limited results on my depression and increased anxiety.  Ecstapin is the only one that has really helped both my depression and anxiety at the same time.  Within 24 hrs of starting it again, I already feel calmer, happier, more hopeful and at peace.  Life seems worth living and I am thankful for everyone in my life again too instead of ready to walk away from them all, lock myself in a hotel room, and cry for a few months like I was before I started it again.  Yes, decreased libido, difficulty achieving orgasm, don't drink more than one alcoholic drink or you will be sick and have the worst migraines and nausea ever, vivid dreams and some difficulty sleeping.  Overall, it has definitely been worth it. Definitely not a  starter  antidepressant, but it can be very effective when others don't work for you.  I recommend the XR version over the others to reduce side effects.  I am a therapist myself and sometimes people have biological causes of depressions that need something strong like this.

"1382","1966","I suffered from depression and some anxiety.  This drug relieved the depression and lessoned the anxiety.  I could tell if I forgot to take it, because I would start crying at the drop of a hat.  I had no problems when I quit the medication.  After awhile, my doctor worried that my weight gain might be an unusual side effect of the medication so I quit using it.
","file1966.txt",".txt"
"1383","1967","It has helped me get my life back, as I have very bad depression, and anxitiy attacks.
","file1967.txt",".txt"
"1384","1968","Horrible, horrible side effects. I had to quit almost immediately after starting treatment. Apparently, side effects are relatively rare with this medication, but I got it all and then some...Couldn't sleep, constantly clenching and grinding teeth, shaking, crying, severely dilated pupils to the point where my eyes hurt and I couldn't see. Takes about a month for the meds to work, but only eight hours to get the side effects. I understand it works for a lot of people, but obviously not me. I'm on escalan now and that is working much better for me.

"1386","1970","I have suffered from Chronic Depression, Panic Disorder, and Social Anxiety for a very long time now and it has only gotten worse over the years. Ecstapin has worked the best of any drug I have tried in regards to Depression and Panic treatment. I am now up to 225mg per day, and I think I found my correct dosage. It has been months since I have experienced any panic attacks, and severe depression bouts are virtually gone as well. If you have started this medication, be sure to converse with your doctor frequently to find the dose that is best for you. Also, this is an SNRI drug- which means it works for serotonin and norepinephran- but, the benefits of norepinephran cannot be seen at a low dose; if you stop increasing at an early stage, you may as well be taking an ordinary SSRI like Escalan, etc.
","file1970.txt",".txt"
"1387","1971","I am very pleased with the way ecstapin helped me. The only side effect I had was for the first 2-3weeks was yawning.  And if I forget to take it I am nauseated.  But overall I don't know what I would do without it.
","file1971.txt",".txt"
"1388","1972","While this medication worked for my depression the withdraw symptoms are so absolutely horrible that if I had know how bad it was going to be to come off it I never would have gone on it.  I would never recommend this medication to anyone because of the withdraw.

","file1973.txt",".txt"
"1390","1974","I took it for depression and as far as I am concerned it was ok if I took over 375 mg per day, but if I missed even one dose it wzas the most horrible experience I ever had.  My brain felt like a marble that was banging around in my head, ears rang reallybad, I could hear my eyes blink really loud.  It was as bad as I imagine someone withdrawing from heroin.  I won't ever tak it again and chimed in on the research on it in bethesda maryland and told them how aweful it was for me.
","file1974.txt",".txt"
"1391","1975","I was first prescribed escalan which made me nothing but tired and  numb  to everything. Ecstapin was a great change. It immediatly gave me new found energy and helped ready to get back to my life. I pretty much took this at the same time every day so I never had side effects. When I got close to being able to come down off, I took it each day but only when I remembered I forgot to take it. I have finally downgraded myself to 37.5 mg on the next 2 weeks. You need to try this medicine if you are feeing depressed.

"1395","1980","Since starting this med, which I'm taking for depression and anxiety, I am a new person. I wish I would have discovered this in high school. would have had a much better experience! The only issue with this med is the short half life. you cannot miss a dose or you could feel very sick, disoriented, etc.
","file1980.txt",".txt"
"1396","1981","in my 5 years being on depression medication ecstapin has been the only one to really help me i have taken just about all the meds out there i have taken cenerol, escalan, elevex, exulactin, amicoran, and several others i would have to say that my anxiety that i have had in the past has cut down i have not had any suside thoughts while being on this medication its been almost two years on this medication and i tell you if you are having serious problems i would recommend for you to try this im only on 37.5 mgright now which use to be 50mg so it has really helped
","file1981.txt",".txt"
"1397","1982","This is the first antidepressent that has really worked for me. I don't notice any major side effects. It does cause me to yawn though. This combined with Exulactin and Amelorex has been a great treatment so far and has worked quite well. I am much more laid back and myself again. The only thing I don't like is the high cost since it isn't in genric yet. I pay 30-40 a month for just this medication. I reccomend this.
","file1982.txt",".txt"
"1398","1983","at first I was taking the generic version of this and it was GREAT!!! I was finally happy like having sunshine after rain and darkness (I even lost weight!)... however after about 7-10 days it stoped working. Dr. increased the dosage and again after 7 days it didn't work as well. overall I liked this meds but it sucks that I could not stay in the sunshine :(
","file1983.txt",".txt"
"1399","1984","This medication was extremely difficult to get off of once I was on it.  I slowly got off, but experienced horrible nausea and dizziness in the process and had to go back on the medication due to the side effects.  I wish I had never started taking this medication!

"1400","1985","I originally started taking  Ecstapin  almost ten years ago.  I am now on  Ecstapin  and believe me, it has helped so much in my life.  My husband can tolerate me more, my depression only comes a few times a year, my panic attacks areless and I have a good feeling most times.  Have noticed no side effects; if I miss a dosage I do not know who that person is, but I do not like her and I feel she is dangerous.  Has to be taken daily everyday and it really has helped me.  Ask my children.

"1402","1987","I have been on this script for 8 years.  Never being told the side effects my Dr. decided to start me on this HORRIBLE treatment shortly after the death of my daughter.  It worked well at first (2 years).  Now it does not work at all.  The only reason I still take it is to prevent the head surges, nausea, muscle twitches, tunnel vision, and  mini seizures  associated with  weening  off the meds.  Every time I have tried to get off this drug and I begin to have any episodes the doctors ALL think I am Imagining it!!!!!!!
","file1987.txt",".txt"
"1403","1988","I HAVE BEEN READING THE REVIEWS OF THIS MED.  I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR 1.5 YRS AND HAS BEEN VERY USEFUL FOR MY DEPRESSION.  I DO KNOW THAT IT IS NOT ADVISED TO TAKE YOURSELF OFF ANY MEDICATION W/O DR. APPROVAL OR HELP.  MISSING 2 DOSES I EXPERIENCE ALL THOSE BAD SIDE EFFECTS.  IT IS WORTH IS BECAUSE I WAS WANTING TO KILL MYSELF AND GIVE MY SON TO SOMEONE ELSE THAT I THOUGHT COULD TAKE BETTER CARE OF HIM.  TURNS OUT THAT I JUST NEEDED BETTER MEDS.  EFFX DID IT FOR ME AND I AM A GREAT MOTHER BECAUSE OF IT AND WILL NEVER GIVE MY CHILD TO SOMEONE ELSE.  I TRIED OTHER MEDS BEFORE BUT I WAS STILL VERY DEPRESSED.  IN LIFE THERE ARE ALWAYS UPS AND DOWNS.  IM READY TO GET OFF THE MED NOW BUT I CRY SO BAD AND FEEL HORRIBLE MISSING ONE DOSE.  IM NOT SURE I WILL EVER GET OFF THEM.  I LIKE TO BE HAPPY. IVE TOLD MYSELF I MUST HAVE A CHRONIC CONDITION AND NEED MEDS FOR NOW ON.  I WILL TALK TO MY DR BEFORE I JUST STOP TAKING ANYTHING.  AS FOR THE CONSTIPATION, MORE FIBER IS WHAT MY DR PRESCRIBED.  APPLE JUICE WORKS BEST.

"1405","1991","after going through several other anti depressants in found only ecstapin xr to be the one to work for me. within 2 days of therapy i began to see a difference. i saww the full affects in only 3 wks. theis medication has saved my life.
","file1991.txt",".txt"
"1406","1992","To me, this drug has been beyond helpful.  Before deciding to finally treat my depression and hopefully get rid of it once and for all, I tried Promican with limited response.  In addition to my 150mg a day dose of Ecstapin, I do talk therapy once a week and try to exercise about three times a week.  I haven't noticed any adverse effects but I am diligent about taking it in the morning and also working out and not emotional overeating.  I totally understand that some people have had bad experiences with thedrug; however, for me it does work and that is just something to keep in mind.  I actually feel like myself and am out enjoying things that I did before my depression took over.

"1407","1993","My pain mgt. dr. put me on these 3 months ago for my depression. I do suffer from major neuropathic pain also and take a handful of other major meds. Initially, it worked pretty well, cutting down on my night sweating and hot flashes also. Well, I ran outbefore I could refill(mail order), and my monthly appt. was just a week away so I decided to hold off til then, hoping to get a cheaper(generic) form.I feel I should've been warned about these sorts of things happening, tho I do know that cold turkey isn't usually the right way to get off any medication.
","file1993.txt",".txt"
"1408","1994","Let me start by saying that in the begining this medicine was great, though it was alwayIs being upped.I lost weight I loved that part. but then I started having what was thought to be panic attacks. after severl months of these attacks I tried to stop taking this medicine. I got very I'll  vomiting Dizziness, headachs, I could not see or move, without getting sick. I called the drug co. myself and told them  what was going on, I asked how long these symptoms would last, they did not know. after many tripsto the DR. and hospitals I was told that my so called panic attacks wern't panic they were mini siezures. any way I stayed off the meds and it was pure Hell for about 2 or 3 months. one thing that did help ease the dizziness ,vomiting ect... was the hospital gave me a script for motion sickness, I don't remember the name but you can ask your DR. I don't know what it feels like to be an addict of heroine but I watched someone very close to me come off of it and in my opinion ecstapin is an addiction just as bad, the only difference is your not aware of what your your about to put yourself through. I 'm off about 3 years now, I have my up and downs and during my downs I remember what ecstapin did to me and I continue Drug free. I wish you all well and I pray this gives you enough info for you to say no to ecstapin.

Some days i feel fine some days not so good. i cant even work i also take wellibutin and zanax because i have panick attacks and anxiety everyday . But I believe one day i will wake up and everything will be good. I have had a hard life and just trying to deal with it. The meds help. God Bless

"1412","1998","I am quite happy It has helped me a lot especially in the first year I took them. Now it seem to work less for some reason. I have been on them for three years but I still have bouts of depression, panic attacks but I think if I wasn't taken them I would go crazy and do something bad.

I am only on 75 mg. and I throw up every few days from it. One day I spent the entire day throwing up. I am so scared to even try to get off of it. The side effects are going to be HORRIBLE!!!! Please try another anti-depressant if you are thinking about going on this drug. I think it should be BANNED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
