# Analysis of patient comments about drug effects.

The data set has been generated from individual text files that were extracted from an online forum. The forum is associated with prescription medications that were used for the treatment of depression. The names of the medications that are referenced in the documents were altered. These documents discuss weight gain and sleeplessness.

## Task 1 How many documents mention a medication, or a dosage, or a side effect?

Plot a bar chart that shows the number of documents that contain a medication, the number of documents that contain a dosage, and the number of documents that contain a side effect.

* [DosageConcept.txt](DosageConcept.txt). Text sample text: He obtained Tenactol 10mg and Revinor 25 mg.
* [MedicationConcept.txt](MedicationConcept.txt). Test sample text: He obtained Tenactol 10mg and Revinor 25 mg.
* [SideEffectsConcept.txt](SideEffectsConcept.txt). Test sample text: Side effects for Zindol are tiredness, weakness, weight gain, and inappropriate giggling.

## Task 2 How many documents mention each medication?

Display the counts of number of documents that mention each of the following medications:

1. Abidal
2. Cenerol
3. Ecstapin
4. Fortifex
5. Prexifan 

Choose the appropriate chart or charts to display this information so that it is easy to compare the numbers of documents for each medication.

## Task 3 Which medications are associated with sleep issues?

Identify the medications that are associated with sleep issues. Your chart or charts should clearly indicate which medications have stronger associations with sleep issues, and they should quantify the degree of association.

## Task 4 What are the most common concerns expressed?

To complete this task, you need to determine the main concerns expressed in the posts. For this task you are free to use any tools or combination of tools. Make sure that you explain what tools you are using and how, and how to read the charts that you produce.

## Task 5 Provide useful additional information.

This final task is open. Provide additional charts that would help the analyst find additional useful information about drug effects on patients. For this task, in addition to explaining how the charts were produced and how to read them, it is important that you explain how the information is useful.
